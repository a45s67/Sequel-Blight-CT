![Tirma](pic/Tirma.png)

Sometimes the battle takes too much time. I just want to get into the scenes quickly...

## Features
- Character status in map
    - Move speed control
    - Through mode
- Tirma's status
    - Additional HP
    - Additional damage

### Note
The real values of most player data store in memory are `2*val + 1`. Besides, it's 0 for false, 2 for true as for boolean value.

> #### Example
> If you want to change additional HP from 0 to 100.  
> The original value stored in memory is 2\*0+1 = 1, after changing it would be 2\*100+1 = 201.
